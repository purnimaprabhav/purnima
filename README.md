# Purnima PRABHA
Hi there! I'm Purnima, a Master's student in AI with a deep passion for machine learning, personalized education, and natural language processing. I enjoy working on projects that use technology to solve real-world problems, especially in the field of AI-powered learning systems.

When I'm not building AI models, you’ll often find me writing about technology, sharing ideas, or exploring creative outlets like singing. I believe in the power of creativity and collaboration to drive innovation, and I’m always eager to explore new ways to merge technology with art.

Feel free to explore my projects, and let's connect!
